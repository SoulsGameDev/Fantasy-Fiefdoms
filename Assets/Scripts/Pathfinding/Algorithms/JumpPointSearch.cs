    /// <summary>
    /// Jump Point Search (JPS) algorithm optimized for hexagonal grids.
    ///
    /// USE CASE:
    /// Ultra-fast pathfinding on maps with large open areas and consistent terrain costs.
    /// JPS can be 10-40x faster than A* on uniform cost grids by "jumping" over cells
    /// instead of exploring every single cell.
    ///
    /// WHEN TO USE:
    /// - Large open maps with few obstacles (plains, oceans, deserts)
    /// - Uniform or near-uniform terrain costs
    /// - Need extreme performance for real-time pathfinding
    /// - Many long-distance paths being calculated
    ///
    /// ADVANTAGES:
    /// - 10-40x faster than A* on open maps
    /// - Explores dramatically fewer nodes
    /// - Still finds optimal paths
    /// - Memory efficient (fewer nodes in open set)
    ///
    /// DISADVANTAGES:
    /// - Less benefit on maps with many obstacles
    /// - Slightly more complex than standard A*
    /// - Best performance requires uniform costs (can still work with varied costs)
    /// - Path reconstruction requires careful handling
    ///
    /// PERFORMANCE:
    /// - Best case: O(âˆšn) on completely open grids
    /// - Average: 10-40x faster than A* on typical open maps
    /// - Worst case: Similar to A* on highly obstructed maps
    ///
    /// TYPICAL USAGE:
    /// <code>
    /// // Set JPS as active algorithm
    /// PathfindingManager.Instance.SetAlgorithm(PathfindingManager.AlgorithmType.JPS);
    ///
    /// // Find path - much faster on open terrain!
    /// var path = PathfindingManager.Instance.FindPath(start, goal, context);
    ///
    /// // Particularly effective for:
    /// // - Naval pathfinding (open ocean)
    /// // - Desert/plains traversal
    /// // - Air unit pathfinding
    /// // - Strategic map movement
    /// </code>
    ///
    /// HOW IT WORKS:
    /// JPS optimizes A* by identifying "jump points" - cells that must be examined
    /// because they represent potential path changes. Instead of exploring every cell,
    /// JPS "jumps" in straight lines until hitting:
    /// 1. The goal
    /// 2. An obstacle
    /// 3. A forced neighbor (cell adjacent to obstacle, forcing direction change)
    ///
    /// For hex grids, we adapt the concept:
    /// - Jump in all 6 hex directions
    /// - Identify forced neighbors based on hex adjacency
    /// - Handle the unique geometry of hexagonal grids
